# Mahmoud Alfadel

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [DAS](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/) Lab at Concordia University, supervised by Dr. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/). I obtained my master’s degree in Software Engineering from [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/departments/ics/Pages/en/M-S-SWE-Course-Admission-Require.aspx).

My research interests cover a range of software engineering-related topics, including mining software repositories, empirical software engineering, software ecosystems, and security vulnerabilities.

Besides, I have 2 years of experience as a software developer at the [DMS](https://dmsegypt.net/) company, where Data Management Systems for health centres and hospitals are built.
