# Patrick Ayoup

I am a Master’s student at Concordia University’s DAS Lab supervised by [Dr. Emad Shihab](/members/emad-shihab/). Before joining DAS Lab, I received Bachelor’s degrees in Music (B. Mus. in Classical Double Bass Performance from McGill University) and Software Engineering (B. Eng. in Software Engineering from Concordia University).

I am currently doing research on Gamification in Software Engineering.
