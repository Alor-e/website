# Everton Maldonado

My main research interests are Mining Software Repositories, Software Quality Assurance, and Software Maintenance. My project involves the mining of structured and unstructured data from various data sources, such as source code comments, version control repositories (e.g., Git) and issue trackers. The data was pre-processed, cleaned, triangulated and analyzed to develop novel techniques that help in the detection and management of technical debt..
