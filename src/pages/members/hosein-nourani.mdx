# Hosein Nourani

I am a Masters student in the department of computer science and software engineering, Concordia University. I started my research on applied machine learning with my supervisor, [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/), since 2017. I am interested in mechanisms of how systems learn and improve their abilities from their experiences without being explicitly programmed. My mission in [DAS](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/) is focused on developing an ambulatory monitoring system to recognize spatiotemporal human actions.

## Background

I was the CEO and co-founder of D.P.Arian co. for 4 years since 2012. We developed a multiplatform Point-of-Sale (POS) system called [“Sedar”](https://www.aparat.com/dparian), for small and medium businesses.

I got my Bachelor degree from Babol University of technology on 2012, where I was working on clustering applications in solving university timetabling issue.
