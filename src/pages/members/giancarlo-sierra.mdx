# Giancarlo Sierra

I am a Software Engineer Master’s Student (International) & Research Assistant at Concordia University, Montreal-Canada. I am part of the DAS Lab research group under the supervision of [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/), where I am focusing on studying Self-Admitted Technical Debt, and in particular its prioritization. Born and raised in Ecuador. I have keep a permanent interest on technology and software in particular since I can remember. Original ideas move me, and learning is a never-ending quest. Environment & social cooperation are always in my mind. Sports practitioner, music lover, guitar enthusiast.
